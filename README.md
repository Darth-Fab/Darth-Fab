Hi, I’m Fabi

I am a postdoctoral researcher at Human+ lab (Utrecht University). I'm interested in the evolution of human and other species' socio-affective behavior, and how we can employ this information in the development of a robotic platform. I am also fascinated by the predictive computations that our brain does when making social decisions. I preferably program in Python and R-studio, but I also use Matlab, Bash, and Arduino (the latter mostly for fun!). I am always eager to learn, so I am happy to receive any critical advice on my scripts :)
