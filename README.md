Hi, I’m @Darth-Fab
I’m interested in Physiology, Human-Robot Interaction and Evolution. As a budding programmer, I’m currently learning R studio for statistical analysis, statistical models
and plotting. Plus, I'm learning Python for data structuring and pre-processing, but recently I'm also using it to work on robots' SDK.
