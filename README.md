Hi, I’m Fabi

I am a Ph.D. student at the Comparative Psychology and Affective Neuroscience Lab (Leiden University) and Human+ Lab (Utrecht University). I'm interested in the evolution of human and other species' socio-affective behavior, and how we can employ this information in the development of social robots. I program in Python, R-studio, and - quite recently - Arduino. I've barely scratched the surface of programming though.
